         With a single-thread executor, results are guaranteed to be executed in the order in which they are added to the executor service.
         Notice that the end text is output while our thread executor tasks are still running.
         This is because the main() method is still an independent thread from the ExecutorService,
         and it can perform tasks while the other thread is running.
